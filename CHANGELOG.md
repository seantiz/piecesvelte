# Changelog:

## Svelte x Pieces v0.5.0 (2024-12-29)

- We now have properly parsed markdown and codeblocks in our chat messages.

- Fixed UI bug where the first message was disappearing on initial app-loadup state.

## Svelte x Pieces v0.4.2 (2024-12-29)

Fixed UI bug in v0.4.1 where the first query message of a new conversation was disappearing from the chat window

## Svelte x Pieces v0.4.1 (2024-12-29)

- We can start a new conversation with the New Conversation button

### Known Bugs

- Sending a message in a new conversation will lead to the first message disappearing from the chat window UI, even though conversations are still managed correctly and all messages are retrieved correctly when you re-load that conversation from the menu.

## Svelte x Pieces v0.4.0 (2024-12-29)

- The menu now shows the connection status of your local Pieces OS server
- A conversations submenu lists all chat conversations

## Svelte x Pieces v0.3.1 (2024-12-28)

We decided to remove autoprefixer() as the app is unlikely to see use with older browsers. There's also some standardised formatting and whitespace fixes.

## Svelte x Pieces v0.3.0 (2024-12-28)

This is an all-Svelte-5-powered app now as we've removed the selectedModel store and instead are now using a modelsController reactive property to track the selected LLM.

## Svelte x Pieces v0.2.0 (2024-12-28)

This is a big update for a minor version but we wanted to get the open-source app back on track with the recent changes to the Pieces OS distribution in general, especially when it comes to message handling through the web socket.

* Pieces in-app chat client now uses the correct port when opening a websocket to send message to local Pieces OS server
* More robust ModelsController module for selecting chat LLM models
* The chat window correctly sends your questions to any Gemini, Claude or ChatGPT model

## Svelte x Pieces v0.1.2 (2024-11-20)

Added some more utility functions (thanks to @bishoy-at-pieces work on the Python CLI app) for handling filenames and their extensions and for saving code snippets.

## Svelte x Pieces v0.1.1 (2024-11-7)

We migrated the client UI to Svelte 5 with v0.1.1!

* The main page is slimmed down with unused variables cleaned up.
* We moved `components` up one directory and changed the path alias
* We added renamed the `apis` folder to `getFromPieces` to make it clearer which tasks exist to post to the Pieces Open API endpoints and just for better readability.
* Safe loading of the Copilot controller into the client DOM with a browser window check.
* We removed unused dependencies after the move to Svelte 5
